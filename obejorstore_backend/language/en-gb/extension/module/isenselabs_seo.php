<p><h4>Backup is recommended!</h4></p>
<p>Make sure to backup your database and image folder before using this feature.</p>
<br />
<p><h4>How are the image names created?</h4></p>
<p>We use the words from the product name and the model number in order to create relative image names. However, if you wish to change the parameters, you can do that from the "Advanced options" under the blue big button.
<br /><br />
<b>Additional Images</b>
<br />
The additional images use the same name as the main product images followed by a number.
<br />
For example, if the main product image is "product.jpg", the additional images would be:
<ul>
    <li>product-1.jpg</li>
    <li>product-2.jpg</li>
    <li>product-3.jpg</li>
    ...
</ul>
</p>
<br />
<p><h4>What does "Errors" mean in the report?</h4></p>
<p>There has been an error during the renaming process. Permission issues in the server are the most common cause, preventing the script from renaming the images.
<br /><br />
To resolve this, you have to make sure that the PHP user on the server has correct READ/WRITE permissions for the image folder in your store. If you are not sure about that, contact your hosting provider.
</p>
<br />
<p><h4>Clear your OpenCart image cache!</h4></p>
<p>Sometimes OpenCart may continue to cache old filenames. To resolve that, you have to clear the folder system/storage/cache. Also, if you are using CDN services, such as CloudFlare, make sure to clear image/cache as well, so the new images can be cached.</p>';

<p>A higher score is better and indicates that you are using the best techniques to improve your performance on the search engine results pages (SERPs). Some of the factors we account for are:

    <li>How many of your products, categories, manufacturers and information pages have SEO-friendly URLs</li>
    <li>How many of your products, categories and information pages have meta titles, descriptions and keywords</li>
    <li>We check if you have structured data enabled for your products and breadcrumbs</li>
